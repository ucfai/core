    "In this notebook we will be generating unique human faces based off of celebrities. Maybe one of them will look like their kid? This dataset contains around 200,000 pictures of celebrities faces, all of them aligned to the center of the image. This is important so the GAN can learn the features of the face properly when generating. This is important because the network looks for overall features relating each image, and if each image is extremely different (like faces in different places) the network will have a hard time to learn, if at all.\n",

The built in Imagefolder dataset will load in images from all subfolders of the given path, and pass it through our transforms without the need for creating a custom dataset. For time purposes, we will set a variable called `thanos_level` that will cut our dataset in half, thirds, fourths etc so we can train on a subset of the 200,000 images. For 5 Epochs, the whole dataset will take about a half hour to train, half will be 15 minutes, and a fourth will be about 6 minutes. For best results, use the whole dataset! \n",

When this is all done, our RGB scalar values will be between -1 and 1 (from normalizing), inclusive, the same as what our generator output will be.\n",

The few differences is that we are going to use [LeakyReLU](https://medium.com/@danqing/a-practical-guide-to-relu-b83ca804f1f7) which is a adapatation to ReLU. LeakyReLU has a chance to \"leak\" negative values from the function output, instead of zeroing out **all** negative values. This has shown to give better results for the discriminator and help avoid the issues mentioned at the end of the slides.\n",

Its better to have a larger stride to reduce size of the feature maps. Since we want the generator to produce images representing the input, it needs context of the whole image, so max pooling would not help here.\n",

Getting this model to train is another story though, it'll be lot of playing around and trial/error, but for a very amazing result. I suggest you find datasets of cats or some images that you can try to use this model to train on. You can also try your hand on implementing a cGAN or InfoGAN model, using this as a base. Take the time to explore what you can do and try it out!\n",

You would need to add a layer to the generator and discriminator, and probably reduce your batch size and such. You can also try training on the whole dataset for a longer time and see what you get!"

Recently, they made headlines in the DeepFake network, being able to mimic someone else in real time in both video and audio. There has also been cycleGAN, which takes one domain (horses) and makes it look like something similar (zebras). Come and learn the secret behind these type of networks, you will be surprised how intuitive it is! The lecture will cover the basics of GANs and different types, with the workshop covering how we can generate human faces, cats, dogs, and other cute creatures!",
