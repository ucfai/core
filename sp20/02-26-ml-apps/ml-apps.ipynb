This is different from past meetings, as it will be a full workshop. We provide the data sets and a notebook that gets you started, but it is up to you to build a model to solve the problem. So, what will you be doing? We have two datasets, one is using planetary data to predict if a planet is an exoplanet or not, so your model can help us find more Earth-like planets that could contain life! The second dataset will be used to build a model that mimics a pokedex! Well, not fully, but the goal is to predict the name of a pokemon and also predict its type (such as electric, fire, etc.) This will be extremely fun and give you a chance to apply what you have learned, with us here to help!",
