    "NASA's Kepler Mission is a quest to search for planets that may be suitable for life. In order to do this, NASA surveyed many solar systems in the Milky Way and identified planets with unique qualities similar to Earth. These qualities inclue:\n",
    "- Determine the percentage of terrestrial and large planets that are in or near the habitable zoen from a variety of stars\n",

    "## Transit Method of Detecting Extrasolar Planets\n",
    "A \"transit\" is the event where a planet passes in front of a star, as viewed from Earth. Occasionally we can observe Venus or Mercury transit the Sun. Kepler finds planets by looking for tiny dips in the brightness of a star when a planet crosses in front of it. Once detected, the planet's orbital size can be calculated from the period of the orbit, and the mass of the sun can be calculated using Kepler's Third Law. The size of the planet is found by analyzing the dip in the amount of light we perceive here on earth. When we have the planet's orbital size and temperature of the sun, we can assume some characteristics of the planet, such as temperature, and from that we can assume whether or not a planet is habitable.\n",

Some of the images have some noise, like other characters from the show and what not, so this dataset can benefit from some data cleaning by manually going through and removing images that have a lot of noise.    \n",

This is different from past meetings, as it will be a full workshop. We provide the data sets and a notebook that gets you started, but it is up to you to build a model to solve the problem. So, what will you be doing? We have two datasets; one is using planetary data to predict if a planet is an exoplanet or not, so your model can help us find more Earth-like planets that could contain life! The second dataset will be used to build a model that mimics a pokedex! Well, not fully, but the goal is to predict the name of a pokemon and also predict its type (such as electric, fire, etc.) This will be extremely fun and give you a chance to apply what you have learned, with us here to help!",
