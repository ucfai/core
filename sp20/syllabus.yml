    description: In this lecture, we explore powerful yet lightweight models that
      are often overlooked. We will see the power of combining multiple simple models
      together and how they can yield amazing results. You won't believe how easy
      it is to classify with just a line!

      neural networks? In this lecture, you'll actually learn step by step how neural
      networks function and learn. Then, you'll deploy one yourself!"

      or how Siri can even understand your request? In this meeting we'll dive into
      convolutional neural networks and give you all the tools to build smart systems
      such as these. Join us in learning how we can grant our computers the gifts
      of hearing and sight!

    description: "This lecture is all about Recurrent Neural Networks. These are networks
      with memory, which means they can learn from sequential data such as speech,
      text, videos, and more. Different types of RNNs and strategies for building
      them will also be covered. The project will be building a LSTM-RNN to generate
      new original scripts for the TV series \u201CThe Simpsons\u201D. Come and find
      out if our networks can become better writers for the show!"

      It's time to put what you have learned into action. Here, we have
      prepared some datasets for you to build a a model to solve. This is different
      from past meetings, as it will be a full workshop. We provide the data sets
      and a notebook that gets you started, but it is up to you to build a model to
      solve the problem. So, what will you be doing? We have two datasets; one is
      using planetary data to predict if a planet is an exoplanet or not, so your
      model can help us find more Earth-like planets that could contain life! The
      second dataset will be used to build a model that mimics a pokedex! Well, not
      fully, but the goal is to predict the name of a pokemon and also predict its
      type (such as electric, fire, etc.) This will be extremely fun and give you
      a chance to apply what you have learned, with us here to help!

      We’ve learned about linear and statistical models as well as different training paradigms, but we’ve yet to think about how it all began. In Cognitive Computational Neuroscience, we look at AI and ML from the perspective of using them as tools to learn about human cognition, in the hopes of building better AI systems, but more importantly, in the hopes of better understanding ourselves.asdf
