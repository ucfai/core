      You always start with the basics, and with AI it's no different! We'll be
      getting our feet wet with some simple, but powerful, models and
      demonstrate their power by applying them to real world data.

      In this lecture, we explore powerful yet lightweight models that are often
      overlooked. We will see the power of combining multiple simple models
      together and how they can yield amazing results. You won't believe how
      easy it is to classify with just a line!

      You've heard about them: Beating humans at all types of games, driving cars,
      and recommending your next Netflix series to watch, but what ARE neural networks?
      In this lecture, you'll actually learn step by step how neural networks function
      and learn. Then, you'll deploy one yourself!

      convolutional neural networks and give you all the tools to build smart
      systems such as these. Join us in learning how we can grant our computers

      This lecture is all about Recurrent Neural Networks. These are networks
      with memory, which means they can learn from sequential data such as
      speech, text, videos, and more. Different types of RNNs and strategies
      for building them will also be covered. The project will be building a
      LSTM-RNN to generate new original scripts for the TV series "The
      Simpsons". Come and find out if our networks can become better writers
      for the show!

      It's time to put what you have learned into action. Here, we have prepared
      some datasets for you to build a a model to solve. This is different from
      past meetings, as it will be a full workshop. We provide the data sets and
      a notebook that gets you started, but it is up to you to build a model to
      solve the problem. So, what will you be doing? We have two datasets, one
      is using planetary data to predict if a planet is an exoplanet or not, so
      your model can help us find more Earth-like planets that could contain
      life! The second dataset will be used to build a model that mimics a
      pokedex! Well, not fully, but the goal is to predict the name of a pokemon
      and also predict its type (such as electric, fire, etc.) This will be
      extremely fun and give you a chance to apply what you have learned, with
      us here to help!

      How can we infer on the past to predict the future? In this meeting
      we are going to be learning about time series data and its unique
      qualities. After we sharpen up our data science skills, we will be
      putting them to good use by analyzing and predicting the spread of the
      Coronavirus!

    title: A look behind DeepFake - GANs

      GANs are relativity new in the machine learning world, but they have
      proven to be a very powerful architecture. Recently, they made headlines
      in the DeepFake network, being able to mimic someone else in real time in
      both video and audio. There has also been cycleGAN, which takes one domain
      (horses) and makes it look like something similar (zebras). Come and learn
      the secret behind these type of networks, you will be surprised how
      intuitive it is! The lecture will cover the basics of GANs and different
      types, with the workshop covering how we can generate human faces, cats,
      dogs, and other cute creatures!

      We've learned about linear and statistical models as well as different
      training paradigms, but we've yet to think about how it all began. In
      Cognitive Computational Neuroscience, we look at AI and ML from the
      perspective of using them as tools to learn about human cognition, in
      the hopes of building better AI systems, but more importantly, in the
      hopes of better understanding ourselves.
