    description: You always start with the basics, and with AI it's no different!
      We'll be getting our feet wet with some simple, but powerful, models and demonstrate
      their power by applying them to real world data.

    description: In this lecture, we explore powerful yet lightweight models that
      are often overlooked. We will see the power of combining multiple simple models
      together and how they can yield amazing results. You won't believe how easy
      it is to classify with just a line!

    description: 'This lecture is all about Recurrent Neural Networks. These are networks
      with memory, which means they can learn from sequential data such as speech,
      text, videos, and more. Different types of RNNs and strategies for building 
      them will also be covered. The project will be building a LSTM-RNN to generate
      new original scripts for the TV series “The Simpsons”. Come and find out if our
      networks can become better writers for the show!'
