Or you look at the compass, and walk for a few minutes, then check again. Now, imagine your path through the forest. In the first scenerio your path is very jagged and it takes you much longer to get out. The second scenerio your path through the forest is much more a smooth curve, and you leave the forest quickly since you spend less time checking the compass and readjusting.\n",
