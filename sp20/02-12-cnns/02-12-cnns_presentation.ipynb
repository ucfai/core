    "#### Pooling Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Another staple in nearly every CNN architecture are a few **Pooling** layers. Pooling uses a technique known as **Down Sampling**, to reduce the number of parameters in your model, while allowing it to better generalize images across different orientations and scales. This is also known as avoiding **overfitting**. In order to do this a pooling layer uses a sliding technique, similar to our conv. layers, but now applying a statistical function over the contents of its window. The pooling windows are also non-overlapping, allowing this technique to greatly reduce the size of its input and, naturally, decrease the number of parameters in the model.\n",

    "There are many kinds of pooling layers, each with their own advantages and use cases:\n",

    "-  Average Pooling\n",
    "-  Global Poolings\n",
    "-  Etc.\n",

    "#### Dropout Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Another powerful and very popular regularization technique is **Dropout**. Like the name suggests, a dropout layer will randomly drop a chosen percentage of activations by setting them to 0. This means that each batch, at each epoch, will have a random set of activations thrown out, at every drop out layer... \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, this introduces a great deal of variability and forces the model to never memorize any particular arrangement of activations, but to learn to generalize when looking at new, but similar, data. It's important to note that dropout is only used during training. At test time we want to use all the activations possible to achieve the highest accuracy.\n"

    "#### Batch Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past few years of advancement in the field of computer vision, batch norm has stood out as one of the most important techniques for making the training of these large CNNs more accessible to the general public. More specifically, it vastly reduces the number of epochs and training time needed to accurately train a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch Normalization standardizes the input into a layer for each mini-batch by scaling and shifting each activation, so that all the activations in the layer have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1. This normalization stabilizes the learning process and allows you to increase the learning rate of your model. This stabilization effect is visualized in the image below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Explaining exactly why normalizing our inputs has this effect can get quite complicated, but let's think about it for a second. These models are trained through **backpropagation**, meaning, after each mini-batch we calculate our loss, take the gradient, and adjust our weights accordingly so that the next mini-batch has a lower loss with this updated set of weights. Now, because we're constantly updating our weights, this means that the distribution of our inputs is constantly changing after each mini-batch. In short, this is what causes this rough loss landscape that we see below. By normalizing our inputs for each mini-batch we can minimize this effect and greatly smooth out the loss landscape. Now that our loss is much more stable throughout training we can increase the learning rate without much side effect, hence reducing the training time of our model.\n",

    "### Classification Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "So, ultimately, after passing an input through any combination of these layers we've talked about, you end up with a multi channel output of activation matrices, where each channel represents a different high level feature of the original input. This concludes the **feature extraction** portion of a CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the goal of any CNN is to take all of these calculated feature maps, and use them to predict the likelihood that the original input belongs to each class we trained the model on. This is the goal of the **classification** portion of a CNN, the only question remaining is how to accomplish this.\n",

    "#### Global Average Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to apply a fully connected layer to generate our output vector, we need to turn this 3 dimensional output of stacked feature maps into a rank one tensor. One method of doing this is to take the average of each one of these feature maps, which results in a vector of 512 values. Intuitively, each of these values tell us how strongly a feature was present in the original image. Things like whether the original image had brown eyes, or pointy ears, or a fluffy tail, etc.\n",

    "Another option is to simply flatten the rank 3 tensor of activations into a rank one tensor. In this case, it'd result in a 61,952 length vector (11 x 11 x 512). This is useful because we get to keep every single activation from each feature map, however as you can imagine, it requires significantly more memory and computation power. Because of this, most modern architectures seem to opt for the Global Average Pooling method."

    "\n",
    "Regardless of the method you choose, once you're left with a rank one tensor you can now apply a standard fully connected layer (like the ones we saw in our first few neural net meetings). Remember that a fully connected layer is nothing more than a matrix multiplication by a weight matrix, which can be learned. This fully connected layer aims to take our vector of activations and turn it into a vector of length equal to the number of classes we're trying to predict (in this case 37).\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, the last thing we need to do is apply a final activation function to turn each of these values into a percentage. By far the 2 most popular functions for this are the Softmax and Sigmoid functions, which are both only ever used in the final layer of a CNN.\n",

This is because it can take in the output of our fully connected layer and create a probability distribution. In other words, each output value is non-negative and adds to 1. We'll look at an example of this in excel to gain a better understanding in just a second.\n",
