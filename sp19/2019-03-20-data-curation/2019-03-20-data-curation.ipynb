Unfortunately, you will find that the majority of datasets you encounter will be filled with  missing, malformed, or erroneous data. Thankfully, Python provides a number  of handy libraries to help you clean and manipulate your data into a usable state. In today's lecture, we will leverage these Python libraries to turn a messy dataset into a gold mine of value!",
