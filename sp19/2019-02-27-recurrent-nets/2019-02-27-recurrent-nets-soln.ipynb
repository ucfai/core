This is taken from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) dataset on kaggle. This model can be applied to any text. We could use more episodes from the Simpsons, a book, articles, wikipedia, etc. It will learn the semantic word associations and being able to generate text in relation to what it is trained on.
