    Welcome back to SIGAI! We'll be re-introducing AI@UCF for newcomers and
    refreshing it for veterans; following that, we'll cover some club logistics,
    revealing our plans for the semester, and finish off with setting everyone
    up on the UCF Supercomputer, from which we'll be streaming all future
    meetings!

    You always start with the basics, and with Data Science it's no different!
    We'll be getting our feet wet with some simple, but powerful, models and 
    demonstrate their power by applying them to real world data.

    This lecture is all about Recurrent Neural Networks. These are networks
    with memory, they can learn on data that is sequential in nature, such as speech,
    text, videos, gestures, traffic, stock prices, and many types of medical data.
    Different types of RNNs and strategies for building them will also be covered.
    The project will be building a LSTM-RNN to generate new original scripts for 
    the TV series “The Simpsons”. Come and find out if our networks can become
    better writers for the show!

    In the fields of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, your models and 
    analyses will only be as good as the data behind them. Unfortunately, you
    will find that the majority of datasets you encounter will be filled with 
    missing, malformed, or erroneous data. Thankfully, Python provides a number 
    of handy libraries to help you clean and manipulate your data into a usable
    state. In today's lecture, we will leverage these Python libraries to turn
    a messy dataset into a gold mine of value.

    In this meeting, we'll cover the fundamentals of programming in Python, with
    a particular focus on thinking of how to use said tools for Data Science,
    Machine Learning, and generally Artificial Intelligence research and
    engineering.

    Derivatives. Matrices. Vectors. Gradients. Mean. Standard Deviation. If any
    of those were unfamiliar, make sure you don't miss this meeting, as these
    are all the math you need to know! No math background? No worries. This
    lecture is intended to get everyone up to speed, regardless of their
    academic focus.
