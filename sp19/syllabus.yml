    Welcome back to SIGAI! We'll be re-introducing AI@UCF for newcomers and
    refreshing it for veterans; following that, we'll cover some club logistics,
    reveal our plans for the semester, and finish off with setting everyone
    up on the UCF Supercomputer, from which we'll be streaming all future
    meetings!

    You always start with the basics, and with Data Science it's no different!
    We'll be getting our feet wet with some simple, but powerful, models and 
    demonstrate their power by applying them to real world data.

    You've heard about them: Beating humans at all types of games, driving cars,
    and recommending your next Netflix series to watch, but what ARE neural 
    networks? In this lecture, you'll actually learn step by step how neural
    networks function and how they learn. Then, you'll deploy one yourself!

    Ever wonder how Facebook can tell you which friends to tag in your photos
    or how Google automatically makes collages and animations for you? This
    lecture is all about that: We'll teach you the basics of computer vision 
    using convolutional neural networks so you can make your own algorithm to
    automatically analyze your visual data!

    This lecture is all about Recurrent Neural Networks. These are networks
    with with added memory, which means they can learn from sequential data such as speech,
    text, videos, and more. Different types of RNNs and strategies for building 
    them will also be covered. The project will be building a LSTM-RNN to generate
    new original scripts for the TV series “The Simpsons”. Come and find out if our
    networks can become better writers for the show!

    Some of the hardest aspects of Machine Learning are the details. Almost every
    algorithm we use is sensitive to "hyperparameters" which affect the initialization,
    optimization speed, and even the possibility of becoming accurate. We'll cover the
    general heuristics you can use to figure out what hyperparameters to use, how to 
    find the optimal ones, what you can do to make models more resilient, and the like.
    This workshop will be pretty "down-in-the-weeds" but will give you a better intuition
    about Machine Learning and its shortcomings.

    In the fields of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, your models and 
    analyses will only be as good as the data behind them. Unfortunately, you
    will find that the majority of datasets you encounter will be filled with 
    missing, malformed, or erroneous data. Thankfully, Python provides a number 
    of handy libraries to help you clean and manipulate your data into a usable
    state. In today's lecture, we will leverage these Python libraries to turn
    a messy dataset into a gold mine of value!

    Neural Nets are not the end all be all of Machine Learning. In this lecture, 
    we will see how a decision tree works, and see how powerful a collection of 
    them can be. From there, we will see how to utilize Random Forests to do digit 
    recognition.

    We'll be covering the foundational mathematics for Machine Learning, spanning
    Multivariate Calculus to Linear Algebra and sprinkle in some Statistics. 
    Followed by coverage of fundamental programming ideas for Data Science, 
    Machine Learning, and generally AI research and engineering.

    Some of your best time spent as an undergrad happens right through research. You have
    the opportunity to work with experts in their field just by attending a university.
    Despite this, most of us squander that opportunity because reaching out is daunting. Let's
    overcome that challenge together with some tips and tricks from current undergrad
    researchers at UCF!
