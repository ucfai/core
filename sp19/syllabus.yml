      You always start with the basics, and with Data Science it's no different!
      We'll be getting our feet wet with some simple, but powerful, models and  demonstrate
      their power by applying them to real world data.

      You've heard about them: Beating humans at all types of games, driving cars,
      and recommending your next Netflix series to watch, but what ARE neural  networks?
      In this lecture, you'll actually learn step by step how neural
      networks function and how they learn. Then, you'll deploy one yourself!

      Ever wonder how Facebook can tell you which friends to tag in your photos
      or how Google automatically makes collages and animations for you? This
      lecture is all about that: We'll teach you the basics of computer vision  using
      convolutional neural networks so you can make your own algorithm to
      automatically analyze your visual data!

      This lecture is all about Recurrent Neural Networks. These are networks
      with with added memory, which means they can learn from sequential data such
      as speech,
      text, videos, and more. Different types of RNNs and strategies for building  them
      will also be covered. The project will be building a LSTM-RNN to generate
      new original scripts for the TV series “The Simpsons”. Come and find out if
      our
      networks can become better writers for the show!

    title: What Makes Deep Learning More of an Art Than a Science?
    authors: [ionlights]
    filename: hyperparamter-tuning

    abstract: >-
      Some of the hardest aspects of Machine Learning are the details. Almost every
      algorithm we use is sensitive to "hyperparameters" which affect the initialization,
      optimization speed, and even the possibility of becoming accurate. We'll cover
      the
      general heuristics you can use to figure out what hyperparameters to use, how
      to  find the optimal ones, what you can do to make models more resilient, and
      the like.
      This workshop will be pretty "down-in-the-weeds" but will give you a better
      intuition
      about Machine Learning and its shortcomings.

    title: Cleaning and Manipulation a Dataset with Python

      In the fields of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, your models and  analyses
      will only be as good as the data behind them. Unfortunately, you
      will find that the majority of datasets you encounter will be filled with  missing,
      malformed, or erroneous data. Thankfully, Python provides a number  of handy
      libraries to help you clean and manipulate your data into a usable
      state. In today's lecture, we will leverage these Python libraries to turn
      a messy dataset into a gold mine of value!

      Neural Nets are not the end all be all of Machine Learning. In this lecture,  we
      will see how a decision tree works, and see how powerful a collection of  them
      can be. From there, we will see how to utilize Random Forests to do digit  recognition.

    room: HEC 119
    abstract: >-
      Support Vector Machines were among the most highly used ML algorithms before
      Neural Nets came back into the foreground. Unlike Neural Nets, SVMs can explain
      themselves quite well and allow us to use these ML mdels in fields like medicine,
      finance, and the like – where regulations require that we can inquire about
      our
      models.
