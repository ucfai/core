    Welcome back to SIGAI! We'll be re-introducing AI@UCF for newcomers and
    refreshing it for veterans; following that, we'll cover some club logistics,
    then we'll finish off with some live demos of the work some Coordinators
    have done recently to give you a taste of what's possible! We lied, we'll
    actually finish off with setting everyone up on the UCF Supercomputer, from
    which we'll be streaming all future meetings!
