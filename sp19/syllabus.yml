    Welcome back to SIGAI! We'll be re-introducing AI@UCF for newcomers and
    refreshing it for veterans; following that, we'll cover some club logistics,
    then we'll finish off with some live demos of the work some Coordinators
    have done recently to give you a taste of what's possible! We lied, we'll
    actually finish off with setting everyone up on the UCF Supercomputer, from
    which we'll be streaming all future meetings!

    This lecture is all about Recurrent Neural Networks. These are networks with memory,
    they can learn on data that is sequential in nature, such as speech, text, videos, gestures,
    traffic, stock prices, and many types of medical data. Different types of RNNs and
    strategies for building them will also be covered. The project will be building a LSTM
    RNN to generate new original scripts for the T.V series “The Simpsons”. Come and
    find out if our networks can become better writers for the show!

    In this meeting, we'll cover the fundamentals of programming in Python, with
    a particular focus on thinking of how to use said tools for Data Science,
    Machine Learning, and generally Artificial Intelligence research and
    engineering.

    Derivatives. Matrices. Vectors. Gradients. Mean. Standard Deviation. If any
    of those were unfamiliar, make sure you don't miss this meeting, as these
    are all the math you need to know! No math background? No worries. This
    lecture is intended to get everyone up to speed, regardless of their
    academic focus.
