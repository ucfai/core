        Welcome back to SIGAI! We'll be re-introducing SIGAI for newcomers and
        refreshing it for veterans. Following that, we'll cover some basics of
        generating graphs (a very common task for data science and research). If
        you're enticed, we'll also get you setup on the university's
        supercomputer, as all following meetings will stream from there! :smiley:

        Data is arguably more important than the algorithms we'll be learning
        this semester - and that data almost always needs to be curated and
        finagled to really develop an understanding of what the data is trying
        to tell you.

        Neural Networks are all the rage, nowadays, but simpler models are
        always great places to start! We'll cover how to do Linear/Logistic
        Regression as well as preparing data for such a function to work.

        With some basic ideas in mind about how one might tackle a task, we'll
        now go and explore a Tensor framework (PyTorch) and build a Neural
        Network that can accurately predict XXXX from our dataset.
