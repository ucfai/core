    "> - a powerful N-dimensional array object\n",
    "> - sophisticated (broadcasting) functions\n",
    "> - tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code\n",
    "> - useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\n",

    "### So what's that actually mean, for us?\n",
    "You'll see more, tonight, but effectively, `numpy` is library that allows us to work with linear algebra, be lazy, and perform array operations on a much larger (and more efficient) scale than Python's `list` allows for! :D"
