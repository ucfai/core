    "\n",
    "So, say we wanted to minimize a simple function like $f(x) = x^4 + x^2 -4 x^2 + 10$. In order to find the minimum of the function, you find $\\frac{d}{dx}(f(x))$  solve for $x$ and plug the answer back into $f(x)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So $\\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)) = 4x^3 + 2x - 8 x = x^2 (4x - 6)$. Then we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$x^2 =0$ and $4x-6 = 0$. So our $x$ is $0$ and $\\pm \\frac{3}{2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "then we plug in $f(x)$ and get $(0,10)$, $(-3/2, 31/4)$, $(3/2, 31/4)$. So we technically have two global minima. That method of minimizing the function is exact. \n",

    "But what do we do for real world problems that can not be boiled down to a nice differentible function? \n",

    "Well, we end up guessing, which works when we don't care if we have the exact solution (i.e. the absolute minimum). \n",

The idea is that we need to explore in order to make sure that we did not miss anything that could be hiding in the solution space, but we also need to exploit what we know so that we can get as close as we can to the right solution. The problem is that these two ideas are competing with each other; often if we are exploring we can not exploit and if we are exploiting we can not explore. The balance of these two ideas is pretty much what the field of heuristics is all about (and the \"correct\" method and parameter tuning often depends on the solution you are trying to solve).  \n",

When the metal is super hot, we are going to explore the solution space more, and as we cool, we are going settle in on specific spots in the space that have produced good results. \n",

    "So, it might make more sense now that we have finished the lecture to talk about the general performance. Unfortunately with heuristics talking about preformance is really annoying because it depends on the input parameters. One thing that is pretty neat is that you can check the difference between the \"best\" solution generated from the brute force code the neighbor solutions brute force code. Why should one always be lower than the other? Additionally, you can play with the parameters to find \"optimal\" parameters, research will usually refer to this as hyper parameter tunning. \n",
