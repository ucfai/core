    "#### 2. Amount\n",
    "\n",
    "Amount is the amount that the transaction was for. \n",
    "The denomination of the transactions was not given, so we're going to be calling them \"Simoleons\" as a place holder. \n",
    "Some interesting points about this feature is the STD, or standard deviation, which is 250§. That's quite large, \n",
    "but makes sense when the min and max are 0§ and 25,691§ respectively. \n",
    "There is a lot of variance in this feature, which is to be expected. The 75% amount is only in 77§, \n",
    "which means that the whole set skews to the lower end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us if the transaction was fraud or not. 0 is for no fraud, 1 if it is fraud. \n",
    "If you look at the mean, it is .001727, which means that only .1727% of the 284,807 cases are fraud. \n",
