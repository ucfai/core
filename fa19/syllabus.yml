    Welcome back or welcome aboard to AI@UCF! We'll be covering what we do, 
    how we do it, and what opportunities are available for you. Food and drink
    will be provided, so take the time to eat, chat, and learn about our club.
    See you there!

    Ever wonder how Facebook tells you which friends to tag in your photos,
    or how Siri can even understand your request? In this meeting we'll dive
    into convolutional neural networks and give you all the tools to build
    smart systems such as these. Join us in learning how we can grant our 
    computers the gifts of hearing and sight!

    It's easy enough to navigate a 16x16 maze with tables and some dynamic programming, but
    how exactly do we extend that to play video games with millions of pixels as input, or 
    board games like Go with more states than particals in the observable universe? The answer,
    as it often is, is deep reinforcement learning.
