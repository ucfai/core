      Welcome back or welcome aboard to AI@UCF! We'll be covering what we do,
      how we do it, and what opportunities are available for you. Food and drink
      will be provided, so take the time to eat, chat, and learn about our club.
      See you there!

      In this lecture, we explore powerful yet lightweight models that are often 
      overlooked. We will see the power of combining multiple simple models together
      and how they can yield amazing results. You won't believe how easy it is to 
      classify with just a line!

      You've heard about them: Beating humans at all types of games, driving cars,
      and recommending your next Netflix series to watch, but what ARE neural 
      networks? In this lecture, you'll actually learn step by step how neural
      networks function and learn. Then, you'll deploy one yourself!

      You know what they are, but "how do?" In this meeting, we let you loose on a   
      dataset to help you apply your newly developed or honed data science skills. 
      Along the way, we go over the importance of visulisations and why it is 
      important to be able to pick apart a dataset.

      Ever wonder how Facebook tells you which friends to tag in your photos,
      or how Siri can even understand your request? In this meeting we'll dive
      into convolutional neural networks and give you all the tools to build
      smart systems such as these. Join us in learning how we can grant our 
      computers the gifts of hearing and sight!

      This lecture is all about Recurrent Neural Networks. These are networks
      with memory, which means they can learn from sequential data such as speech,
      text, videos, and more. Different types of RNNs and strategies for building 
      them will also be covered. The project will be building a LSTM-RNN to generate
      new original scripts for the TV series “The Simpsons”. Come and find out if our
      networks can become better writers for the show!

      GANs are relativity new in the machine learning world, but they have proven to be a very
      powerful model. Recently, they made headlines in the DeepFake network, being able to mimic
      someone else in real time video and audio. There has also been cycleGAN, which takes one domain (horses)
      and makes it look like something similar (zebras). Come and learn the secret behind these type of networks,
      you will be suprised how intuitive it is! The lecture will cover the basics of GANs and different types,
      with the workshop covering how we can generate human faces, cats, dogs, and other cute creatures!

      It's easy enough to navigate a 16x16 maze with tables and some dynamic
      programming, but how exactly do we extend that to play video games with
      millions of pixels as input, or board games like Go with more states than
      particals in the observable universe? The answer, as it often is, is deep
      reinforcement learning.
