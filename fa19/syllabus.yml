    Welcome back or welcome aboard to AI@UCF! We'll be covering what we do, 
    how we do it, and what opportunities are available for you. Food and drink
    will be provided, so take the time to eat, chat, and learn about our club.
    See you there!

    You need to start with the basic, and in this meeting we are doing just that! 
    We will be goig over the basics of What Machine Learning is and how we can use 
    models to do awesome stuff.

    In this lecture, we explore powerful yet lightweight models that are often 
    overlooked. We will see the power of combining multiple simple models together
    can yield amazing results, and how easy it is to classify with just a line.

    You've heard about them: Beating humans at all types of games, driving cars,
    and recommending your next Netflix series to watch, but what ARE neural 
    networks? In this lecture, you'll actually learn step by step how neural
    networks function and how they learn. Then, you'll deploy one yourself!

    You konw what they are, but how do? In this meeting, we let you lose on a   
    dataset to help you with applying your new Datascience skills. Alog the way,
    we go over the importance of visulisations and why it is important to be able 
    to pick apart a dataset.

    Ever wonder how Facebook tells you which friends to tag in your photos,
    or how Siri can even understand your request? In this meeting we'll dive
    into convolutional neural networks and give you all the tools to build
    smart systems such as these. Join us in learning how we can grant our 
    computers the gifts of hearing and sight!
