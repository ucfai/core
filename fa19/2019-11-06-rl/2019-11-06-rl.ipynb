    "With our improved reward function, the learned policy now seems to be more closely dependant on velocity. It decides to move left when the velocity is negative, and right when velocity is positive. As the results show, this is much more effective in solving MountainCar.\n",

    "If you think about it, what this is doing is enabling the car to drive as far up a hill as possible. When momentum fades and the car begins to fall back down the mountain, our policy tells the engine to drive as fast as possible down this hill. After doing this enough times, the car's momentum will carry it over the large hill and past the flag."
