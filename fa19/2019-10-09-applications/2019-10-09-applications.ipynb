It is your task today to try to predict the suicide rate per 100,000 people in a give country. Building a good model for this can help find areas where there might be a high suicide rate so that prevention measures can be put in place to help people before it happens. \n",

    "However, this problem can be changed to a categorical one so that you can use a RF or SVM. To do so, after the data analysis we will get some statistics on mean, min, max etc of suicide rate per 100,000 people column. Then, you can define ranges and assign them to a integer class. For example, assigning 0-5 suicides/100k as \"Low\", 5-50 as \"High\" etc. You can make as many ranges as you want, then train on those classes. In this case, we want to focus on producing actual values for this, so we will stick with regression, but this is something really cool you can try on your own! (Hint: use pandas dataframe apply function for this!)\n",
